# Storyteller Box: Quick Start Guide

Welcome to your Storyteller Box! This little box is ready to bring magical stories to life. Here’s how to use it:

## 1. Getting Started

*   **Turn it On**: Connect the power cable to the box. If there's a power switch, flip it to the ON position.
    *   You should hear a little startup sound, and the light on the box will turn on.
*   **Ready Light**: When the light is gently "breathing" (getting brighter and dimmer slowly), the box is ready for a story card!

## 2. Playing a Story

*   **Pick a Card**: Choose one of your special story cards.
*   **Tap the Card**: Gently tap the card on top of the box where the card symbol is (or the main flat surface if there's no symbol).
    *   You'll hear a sound to confirm the card is recognized, and then the story will begin!
*   **Volume Control**: There's a knob on the box. Turn it to make the story louder or quieter.

## 3. Using the Main Button

The box has one main button (it might also be the light!). Here’s what it does:

*   **Press Once (Tap)**:
    *   If a story is playing, this will **PAUSE** it.
    *   If a story is paused, this will **RESUME** playing.
*   **Press Twice Quickly (Double-Tap)**:
    *   This will play a **NEW story** from the *same card* you last used. Great for variety!
*   **Press and Hold (Long-Press for a few seconds)**:
    *   This will **TURN OFF** the Storyteller Box. You'll hear a shutdown sound.

## 4. Understanding the Light

The light on the box tells you what it's doing:

*   **Breathing Light**: The box is awake and waiting for you to tap a card.
*   **Solid Light**: A story is currently playing.
*   **Pulsing or Changing Colors Briefly**: The box is thinking – like when it's loading a new story.
*   **Quick Blinking Light (often red or a different color)**: Oops! Something might be wrong.
    *   The card might not have been read properly. Try tapping it again.
    *   It could be an unknown card.

## 5. Automatic Sleep

*   To save energy, the Storyteller Box will automatically turn itself off if no new story has been played for a while (usually about 30 minutes).
*   Just tap a card or press the button to wake it up if it has power. If it turned off completely, you might need to turn it on again using the power switch/cable.

## 6. Keyboard Controls (If you have a keyboard connected)

If a keyboard is connected to your Storyteller Box, you can also use these keys:

*   **'P' key**: Pause or Resume the story.
*   **'N' key**: Play a NEW story from the *same* card.
*   **'Q' key or 'ESC' key**: Turn OFF the Storyteller Box.

## 7. Simple Troubleshooting

*   **No Sound?**
    *   Make sure the volume knob isn't turned all the way down.
    *   Check if the story is paused (try tapping the button once).
*   **Card Not Working?**
    *   Try tapping the card again, right in the center of the box.
    *   Make sure you're using one of the special Storyteller cards.
*   **Box Seems Stuck?**
    *   Try turning it off by pressing and holding the button, then turn it back on.

Enjoy your stories!
